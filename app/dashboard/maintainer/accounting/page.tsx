                    Tracks monetary flows within the 3D printing service across academic semesters. Categorizes transactions by semester (Fall: August-December, Spring: January-May, Off-Season: remaining months) and calculates key financial metrics to ensure operational balance.

                    A non-negative estimated income does NOT mean we have access to that money. At the moment, we do not track user-facing price vs actual costs so this value is unknown.
